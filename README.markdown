# üñ®Ô∏è Printing OCaml Runtime Representations

A small library I wrote when hacking the OCaml compiler. Caveats: the parsing of `infix` and `closure` blocks is incomplete, and the code might only work for OCaml 5.0.

## API and Example Code

This library only exposes an ugly printer [pp] that dumps the runtime representation of any OCaml value.

```ocaml
(* This line prints out [(42, ()) is represented as variant0(int(42),int(0))] *)
let () = Format.printf "@[(42, ())@ is@ represented@ as@ %a@]@." Objdump.pp (42, ())
```
